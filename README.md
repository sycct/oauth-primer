# Oauth Primer

Doing to a mini-project to help me get better at integarting Oauth into a project. Tried using the js/ts ecosystem, but it proved somewhat difficult (mostly dur to passportJs poor ts documenation). Decided to use my goto language for scripting and lightweight tasks, and that is why the project is coded primarily in python.

Packages used include:
- Flask
- SqlAlchemy
- bootstrap

a more comprehensive list can be found in the [`requiremnets.txt`](./requirements.txt) file
